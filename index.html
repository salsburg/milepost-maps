        <p>Explore top 1000 population cities in CONUS, along with growth rates.  Notice negative growth from large cities like NYC, Chicago, LA; while southern belt cities with larger growth.  Move mouse over each city to see populations 2020-2024, and annualized growth rates.  Good proxy for trucking freight absorbtion is population.  Connecting population centers, analyzing growth rates, raw population figures, and major (motorway and truck) US highway system corridors, along with overnight truck parking supply/demand dynamics, among other factors, leads to data driven ideal site selection for new truck stop locations.</p>

        <h2>Dedicated Private Parking - Other than Truck Stops and Public Facilities (Private Alternatives)</h2>
        <p>Dedicated private parking facilities are an increasingly important alternative to traditional truck stops and public rest areas, offering secure and reliable space for drivers to park equipment, stage loads, or rest without the congestion of fuel and retail operations. Typically located near industrial corridors, distribution hubs, or highway interchanges, these sites vary in scale from small yards with just a few bobtail spots to large lots with more than a hundred tractor-trailer spaces. Many provide controlled access, lighting, and security measures, while flexible leasing options—ranging from daily to monthly reservations—allow both independent operators and fleets to plan more efficiently. By expanding safe, reservable capacity in areas where public parking is scarce, private facilities reduce pressure on overburdened truck stops, help drivers remain compliant with Hours of Service rules, and improve the flow of freight into urban and high-demand regions.</p>
